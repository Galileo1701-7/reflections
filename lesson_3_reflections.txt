When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to share with others... also as a backup... also allow you to work from multiple machines



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you may want the local, original repository to be the MASTER so that other peoples changes arent automatically pushed to you

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
fork is a clone on git hub
clone is copying a repository FROM github
branch is a copy or diversion from the master

When would you use one instead of another?
see above

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
working offline
